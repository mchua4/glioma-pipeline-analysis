This pipeline analyses the GDS1962 glioma dataset to evaluate the effects of glioma grades on differential gene expression.
Data processing was performed by removing outliers and filtering out genes with low expression. 

Compare gene expression between glioma grades: One-way Anova test and Student's T-test
Feature selection: Bonferroni, Holm-Bonferroni, and SVM-RFE. 
Dimensionality reduction: Kruskal non-metric MDS and weighted graph Laplacian plot.
Clustering: Hierarchical clustering with Manhattan distance metric and median linkage method; K-means clustering with k=2
